[1] 
Raw fastq file of K6KOP902_S40 sample from <RNAseq_Scarisbrik> has issues related to string.
While using trimmomatic.py, it magically gains whitespaces in output strings.
The problem was avoided using temp/trimmomatic_general.py
However, keep in mind that this mforge has some string errors. (and I don't know why)
